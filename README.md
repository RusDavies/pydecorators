# Useful Decorators

A focused Python library of useful decorators for everyday reliability, caching, rate limiting, timeouts, and developer ergonomics.

The goal is to provide small, typed, well-tested decorators that work in scripts, CLIs, services, and libraries without requiring a framework or a dependency shrubbery.

## Planned first release

The initial `v0.1.0` scope is:

- `@deprecated`
- `@cache_result`
- `@retry`
- `@rate_limit`
- `@timeout`

## Development status

Pre-alpha. The project foundation exists; decorators are not implemented yet.

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy
pytest
python -m build
```
